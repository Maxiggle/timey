# timeapp

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
This project was gotten from netninja tutorial and i decided to take it as a project to complete the app
i have fixed some crashing of the app
The App fetches Data from an external http Application Programming Interface (API).

I hvae added over 200 countries to this app and the main reason whyI uploaded this course to git was help to work on this app,
as i find it quite difficult to categorize repeating countries with different TimeZone into their continents are Category header.
